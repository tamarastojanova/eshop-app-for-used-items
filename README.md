# eshop-app-for-used-items

**Topic: E-Shop application for buying and selling used items in .NET Framework 4.7.2 using a data-first approach**

**Subject**: Databases, Internet technologies

*The point of this application is, in fact, to test the data-first approach to building applications, which is very popular and frequently used today,
precisely because of the importance of the correct, rational and safe storage of user data in the created database.*

*I started this project by gradually developing a PostgreSQL database. The process consisted of drawing an ER diagram, making a mapping transformation, 
creating initial tables in the database using DDL, creating views in the database and thinking about the forms that will exist in the application, 
as well as writing more complex SQL commands in order to test the connection of the tables in the database and catch existing errors and forgotten aspects. 
You can find some of these build stages in the GitHub repository itself.*

*The application is built in an older version of the .NET framework, so I faced more problems trying to effectively connect it to the created database, 
also implementing custom user authentication, in order to use existing tables from my own database for saving user data.*

*Unfortunately, the application is not hosted, nor is the database, but it is one of the applications that I am extremely proud of. 
I am attaching some photos of the user interface, and in terms of functionality, you will have to trust my development skills.*
